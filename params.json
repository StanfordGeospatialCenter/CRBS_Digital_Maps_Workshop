{"name":"Crbs digital maps workshop","tagline":"A workshop on digital mapping methods for the California Rare Book School","body":"#Workshop Outline:\r\n\r\n##Activity 1 - Introduction to GIS and Digital Mapping talk\r\n\r\n[http://slides.com/staceymaples/gisintro/fullscreen](http://slides.com/staceymaples/gisintro/fullscreen)\r\n\r\n##Activity 2 - Examples of Digital Mapping and \"Fusion\" of Historic and Digital Maps\r\n\r\n**Photogrammar**  \r\n\r\n[http://photogrammar.yale.edu/](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/)\r\n\r\nPhotogrammar is a web-based platform for organizing, searching, and visualizing the 170,000 photographs from 1935 to 1945 created by the United States Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI). The map plots the approximately 90,000 photographs that have geographical information. Customize your search by by photographer, date, and place.\r\n\r\n**Radical Cartography**  \r\n\r\n[http://www.radicalcartography.net/](http://www.radicalcartography.net/)\r\nBill Rankin is a historian and cartographer. His mapping activity is focused on reimagining everyday urban and territorial geographies as complex landscapes of statistics, law, and history. His maps have appeared in publications and exhibitions throughout the US and Europe, including articles in Perspecta, Harvard Design Magazine, and National Geographic and shows at Harvard University, Pratt Institute, the Cartographic Bienalle in Lausanne, the Triennalle di Milano, and the Toronto Images Festival; his maps also traveled for several years with ICI's \"Experimental Geographies\" exhibit. His historical research is about the politics of cartography and navigation in the twentieth century. He teaches at Yale University, where he is an assistant professor of the history of science. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States**\r\n\r\n[http://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/](http://dsl.richmond.edu/historicalatlas/)\r\n\r\nHere you will find one of the greatest historical atlases: Charles O. Paullin and John K. Wright's Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States, first published in 1932. This digital edition reproduces all of the atlas's nearly 700 maps. Many of these beautiful maps are enhanced here in ways impossible in print, animated to show change over time or made clickable to view the underlying data—remarkable maps produced eight decades ago with the functionality of the twenty-first century.\r\n\r\n**Odyssey.js Map produced by students in Michael Kahan's *History of San Francisco* course**  \r\n\r\n[http://web.stanford.edu/~maples/maps/urb150/odyssey.html](http://web.stanford.edu/~maples/maps/urb150/odyssey.html)\r\nA map created by students using CartoDB, Odyssey.js and a basemap layer served from the David Rumsey Map Collection (see below)\r\n\r\n**Food Network map**  \r\n[http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/design/2023/10/2111FF_foodnetwork_online-r3-30.jpg](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/design/2023/10/2111FF_foodnetwork_online-r3-30.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Mapping Profanity**  \r\n[https://cartastrophe.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/full-map-cp-draft.pdf](https://cartastrophe.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/full-map-cp-draft.pdf)\r\n\r\n**A Rogue State Along Two Rivers**  \r\n[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/syria-iraq-isis-rogue-state-along-two-rivers.html?_r=1](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/07/03/world/middleeast/syria-iraq-isis-rogue-state-along-two-rivers.html?_r=1)\r\n\r\n**Sunrise Around the World by Tweet**  \r\n[http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/static_vizz/sunrise.html?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1|1&sql=&zoom=2¢er_lat=22.917922936146045¢er_lon=51.328125#](http://cartodb.s3.amazonaws.com/static_vizz/sunrise.html?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=true&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1|1&sql=&zoom=2¢er_lat=22.917922936146045¢er_lon=51.328125#)\r\n\r\n**Zombie Apocalypse Decision Map**\r\n[http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/09/the-definitive-guide-to-where-to-live-if-you-want-to-survive-a-zombie-apocalypse-the-definitive-guide/?utm_content=buffer65e74&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/09/the-definitive-guide-to-where-to-live-if-you-want-to-survive-a-zombie-apocalypse-the-definitive-guide/?utm_content=buffer65e74&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)\r\n\r\n**Unfolding the earth**  \r\n(Myriahedral projections): [http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/myriahedral/](http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/myriahedral/) \r\n\r\n+ [Alcatraz Escape Revisited](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/15/the-alcatraz-escapees-could-have-survived-and-this-interactive-model-proves-it/)\r\n+ [LA Sheriff Election Results](http://graphics.latimes.com/2014-la-sheriff-primary-map/)\r\n+ [Starwars Galaxy Map](http://www.swgalaxymap.com/)\r\n+ [Demonstrations in Brazil](http://blog.cartodb.com/mapping-the-world-ongoing-demonstrations-in-brazil/)\r\n+ [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/3/15.00/27.00/ALL/grayscale/loss,forestgain?begin=2001-01-01&end=2013-12-31&threshold=30)\r\n+ [Urban Reviewer](http://www.urbanreviewer.org/#map=12/40.7400/-73.9998&sidebar=plans)\r\n+ [Time Travel Between Counties](http://mdweaver.github.io/times_year/) \r\n\r\n\r\n##Additional Digital Mapping Resources\r\n\r\n###Introductory Resources:\r\nTom MacWright’s MapSchool: [http://mapschool.io/](http://mapschool.io/)  \r\nThe Geospatial Revolution: [http://geospatialrevolution.psu.edu/](http://geospatialrevolution.psu.edu/) \r\n\r\n**The Stanford Geospatial Center**  \r\n\r\n[http://gis.stanford.edu](http://gis.stanford.edu)\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Stanford Geospatial Center is to support, encourage and explore the use of geospatial technologies in research and teaching at Stanford University.

If you don't like the map yo uare presented with, you can click on the **Try Another Map** link at the top of the page. \r\n* Once you find a map you like, begin georeferencing by identifying points of coincidence in both maps and place **Control Points** in both maps, starting with the historical map.\r\n* If the map you are given has more than on geographic extent (multiple maps on one page), use the clip tool to define the region of the page you are working on. \r\n  * Click on the Clip Button  \r\n  * Hold down the shift key and define the area you want to work on and adjust the shape using the circular nodes  \r\n  * Use the Delete key to delete nodes under you cursor, if needed.   \r\n  * Return to the Georeferencing view by clicking on the **Control Points** button.   \r\n* Once you have place sufficient control points (be sure to distribute them evenly across the map), you can click on the **Save** button to view your work.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Activity 4 - Crowdsourcing a Map with CartoDB.com and Google Docs\r\n\r\nWe're going to collaborate on a map of San Francisco's oldest bars, today. To do this, we will use several different digital tools. This mimics what one typically does on a real \"Digital Mapping\" project, combining various tools into what one refers to as the \"technical stack.\"\r\n\r\n###Assignment:\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be provided with a piece of paper that has some basic information about one of the bars referred to in this article from [The Thrillist](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/san-francisco/oldest-bars-in-san-francisco).\r\n\r\nThe piece of paper you are given will contain some information of interest in this task, but you will also need to do some research on the internet (just using Google, really) to complete the task.\r\n\r\nResearch the bar you were given and enter the information that is requested into this Google Form [http://bit.ly/crbsform](http://bit.ly/crbsform)\r\n\r\nThe form:\r\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eM3tDAl6G749RBKI3uhHXigrcs4nLOSWieKdRuKTDBk/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eM3tDAl6G749RBKI3uhHXigrcs4nLOSWieKdRuKTDBk/viewform)\r\n\r\nThe Results Spreadsheet:\r\n\r\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10hAFExkk8V3Onfx1E5vD3FRsaLRaxW6V-_JKlq-pOvY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10hAFExkk8V3Onfx1E5vD3FRsaLRaxW6V-_JKlq-pOvY/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n##You will need to do the following to complete the task:\r\n\r\n###Enter the easy stuff first\r\n* The paper you were provided with should have the **Name**, **Year Established**, and the **Neighborhood** for your bar, already researched. \r\n* Enter the above information into the appropriate boxes on the Google Form. \r\n\r\n###Now use Google to search for the bar name (It helps to include the neighborhood, too)\r\n\r\n* Find the Address of the bar and Cut & Paste it into the form\r\n* Find a short description of the bar (The Google results panel on the right often has a succinct description) and paste it into the form\r\n* Find a link to the website or Facebook page for the bar and paste it into the form\r\n\r\n\r\n###You will need to find an image to use in the popup for your bar.  \r\n\r\n* Go to [Google.com](http://www.google.com) and type the name of the bar and it's neighborhood into the search box and hit enter.\r\n* Click on the **Images** link at the top of the Google Search Results Page.\r\n  * *If you happen to find any offensive images (it's the internet, it happens), you can click on the **SafeSearch** button at the top of the page and select \"Filter explicit results,\" to hide most of that type of material.*\r\n* When you find a suitable image On the **Image Results Page** click on it and then click on the  **View Image** button. This should open the **just** image in a new page.\r\n* Copy the URL in the resulting page and paste it into the **Image URL** box on the Google Form.\r\n* Use the Browser's **Back** button to return to the **Image Search Results** and, this time, click on the **Visit page** button to go to the page that contains the image. \r\n* Copy the URL in the resulting page and paste it into the **Image Source URL** box on the Google Form.\r\n\r\n###You will need the location of your bar\r\n\r\n* Use the Browser's **Back** button to return to the Google Image Results page and click on the **Web** link at the top of the page to return to the Web Results view.\r\n* There will probably be a Google Info Panel on the right side of the results page, with an image, map, StreetView, and some detailed information about the bar you are researching.\r\n* Click on the Map to open a view of the location in [maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com)\r\n  * *If for some reason you **don't** see a map, go to [maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com) and search for your bar using the same search term you used originally.*\r\n* Use the Zoom controls to zoom into your bar location, if needed. \r\n* **RIGHT-CLICK** on the icon for your bar and select **What's Here** from the menu that should appear.\r\n* At the bottom of your Google Map, you should see a small rectangle with a StreetView thumbnail image and some information about the location. **Copy & Paste** the Latitude and Longitude coordinates into the appropriate box (latitude or longitude) in the Google Form. [Hint: For San Francisco, the Longitude value should be negative].\r\n\r\n\r\n##Activity 5 - Creating a Map on CartoDB.com with the Data\r\n\r\nHere, I will demonstrate the import of the collected data into CartoDB.com for use in a web map application.\r\n\r\nTime permitting, we will all import the layer and experiment with creating a custom visualization and custom info popups. \r\n\r\nIf you have not, you should go to [CartoDB.com/signup](http://CartoDB.com/signup) and create an account. \r\n\r\nWe will import the data from a CSV exported from this results table:\r\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10hAFExkk8V3Onfx1E5vD3FRsaLRaxW6V-_JKlq-pOvY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10hAFExkk8V3Onfx1E5vD3FRsaLRaxW6V-_JKlq-pOvY/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n##Activity 6 - Creating a StoryMap with Odyssey.js\r\n\r\nThis part of the workshop is a bit \"codey\" for some people, so I will treat this as a demonstration. But, don't forget. There wouldn't be any map data for me to work with, if you hadn't done the research you did in the previous section. \r\n\r\nAs I move through the process of taking our various elements (A georeferenced historic map, a CartoDB Map/Dataset, and the code that I will create in Odyssey.js), I will explain how each of these bits works along with the others to create a visually compelling \"Narrative Map\" of the history of taverns in San Francisco. \r\n\r\nIf, at some point, you'd like to \"get your hands dirty\" so to speak, I've actually created a complete tutorial on the process of creating an application like we are creating today, from scratch. You can find this tutorial on the Stanford Geospatial Center's GitHub repository at:  \r\n [https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/CartoDB_Odyssey_Tutorial_for_Story_Maps](https://github.com/StanfordGeospatialCenter/CartoDB_Odyssey_Tutorial_for_Story_Maps)\r\n \r\n###The Basic Workflow for Creating an Odyssey.js Story Map\r\n\r\nThe following is the basic workflow of creating a Story Map with Odyssey.js, taken from the more complete tutorial materials available at the website referenced, above.\r\n\r\n####Learn a little Markdown\r\n\r\n####Select the Odyssey.js Template you want to Use\r\n\r\n####Customize the config block of Your Odyssey.js Application\r\n\r\n####Add Your CartoDB Map/Data to Your Odyssey.js Application\r\n\r\n####Create Your Slides Using Markdown\r\n\r\n###Adding a Custom Basemap from DavidRumsey.com\r\n\r\n####Find a Map that is Already Georeferenced, or Georeference One\r\n\r\nHere is a link to the one I will use:\r\n[http://rumsey.georeferencer.com/map/0E1wB8zfr9TlxahEYadegT/201501250350-oNA4Vn/visualize](http://rumsey.georeferencer.com/map/0E1wB8zfr9TlxahEYadegT/201501250350-oNA4Vn/visualize)\r\n\r\n####Go to the Embed OGC WMTS Tiles Page for your Map\r\n\r\n[http://rumsey.georeferencer.com/map/0E1wB8zfr9TlxahEYadegT/201501250350-oNA4Vn/wmts](http://rumsey.georeferencer.com/map/0E1wB8zfr9TlxahEYadegT/201501250350-oNA4Vn/wmts)\r\n\r\n####Copy the Web Address of the Map's Tile Service\r\n\r\n####Add the URL to your Odyssey.js Config Block to Change Your Basemap\r\n\r\n####Share your Story Map with Others\r\n\r\n##Activity 5 - John Snow Map Demonstration\r\nThis will be a demonstration of the robust types of analysis you can do using Desktop GIS Applications, like ArcGIS. Here, I will take data digitized from the John Snow Map of the SOHO London Cholera Outbreak of 1854 and subject it to several measures of spatial central tendency, spatial allocation, and even h\"hotspot\" mapping with 3d visualization. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to experiment with this data, you can find the materials for this demonstration, here: [https://stanford.app.box.com/SGCIntroGIS/1/3867907155](https://stanford.app.box.com/SGCIntroGIS/1/3867907155)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
